How to do this:

Get image

Find dimensions

Map an individual image to each portion of image ie 1200 * 800

Pick Smaller number

IE 800

Then Run Yolo Twice one on 800 * 800

And then again on botton 800 and 800 width


SO for now:

Train Yolo on square Images


Right Now:

Define Image size

And reduce images to that Size

1125 x 2436
